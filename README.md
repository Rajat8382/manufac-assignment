## Description 
Projects contain the main container folder `Home` which calls two components `FlavanoidsTable` and `GammaTable` which render their table respectively.
wineData.json is located in `src/assets`. The project also has a utils folder which contains `/constants.js` for the constant value to avoid using magic string
and a utilities file to handle common functions like getMean etc.

Thank you :)
